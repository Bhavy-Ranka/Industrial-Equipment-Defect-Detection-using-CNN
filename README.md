Industrial Equipment Defect Detection using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify industrial equipment images into Defective and Non-Defective categories using supervised deep learning.

Problem Statement

Manual inspection of industrial equipment is inefficient and prone to human error. This project aims to automate defect detection using computer vision and deep learning to improve reliability and inspection speed.

Methodology:

1 Image preprocessing

   Conversion to grayscale
   Resizing to 100x100 pixels
   Pixel normalization

2 Model training

   Binary CNN classifier
   Adam optimizer
   Binary cross-entropy loss

3 Evaluation

  Validation accuracy
  Precision, recall, and F1-score
